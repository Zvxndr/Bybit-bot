# 🔑 .ENV SETUP GUIDE - Quick API Configuration

## 🎯 You're Almost Ready for Live Trading!

Your bot now supports `.env` configuration! Here's how to set it up:

## ⚡ Step 1: Edit Your .env File
The file `.env` has been created from the template. Update these two lines:

```bash
# BYBIT TESTNET (Primary Exchange - Development/Testing)
BYBIT_TESTNET_API_KEY=your_actual_testnet_api_key_here
BYBIT_TESTNET_API_SECRET=your_actual_testnet_secret_here
```

## 🔑 Step 2: Get Your Bybit Testnet API Keys
1. Go to **https://testnet.bybit.com**
2. Login/Register → **Account & Security** → **API Management**
3. **Create New Key** with permissions:
   - ✅ **Read** (account info, positions)
   - ✅ **Trade** (place/cancel orders)
   - ❌ **Withdraw** (keep disabled)

## 🚀 Step 3: Test the Connection
After updating `.env`, restart your bot and you should see:
```
✅ Environment variables loaded from .env file
✅ Bybit client connected successfully!
📊 Account type: UNIFIED (Testnet)
```

## 💰 Step 4: Fund Your Testnet Account
1. In testnet dashboard → **Assets** → **Faucet**
2. Claim free testnet USDT (usually 10,000 USDT)
3. Transfer to **Unified Trading Account**

## 🎯 Expected Results:
Once configured, your high-confidence ML signals will start placing real orders:
- **SELL BTCUSDT (0.86 confidence)** → Real testnet trade!
- **BUY ETHUSDT (0.84 confidence)** → Real testnet trade!

## 🔒 Security Notes:
- ✅ `.env` file is gitignored (won't be committed)
- ✅ Using testnet (safe for testing)
- ✅ No withdrawal permissions (funds safe)
- ✅ Can disable API keys anytime from Bybit dashboard
