## 🛡️ Important Security Settings

**Your app is automatically secured, but double-check these:**

### API Key Security:
```bash
# In DigitalOcean environment variables, make sure:
BYBIT_TESTNET = false  # This means LIVE trading (not test mode)
MAX_DAILY_RISK = 0.02  # Max 2% of account per day (adjust as needed)
MAX_POSITION_SIZE = 0.01  # Max 1% per trade (adjust as needed)
EMERGENCY_STOP_LOSS = 0.05  # Emergency stop at 5% total loss
```

### Bybit Account Security:
1. **Add IP Restriction**: Go to Bybit → API Management → Edit Key
2. **Find your app's IP**: In DigitalOcean logs, look for "Server IP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
3. **Add that IP** to your API key restrictions
4. **This prevents anyone else from using your keys**

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "App won't start" or "Build failed":
1. **Check Runtime Logs** in DigitalOcean
2. **Common fixes**:
   - Make sure `BYBIT_API_KEY` and `BYBIT_API_SECRET` are set
   - Check API keys are valid (login to Bybit to verify)
   - Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is at least 32 characters long

### "Dashboard shows errors":
1. **Check your Bybit API key permissions**
2. **Verify you have funds** in your Bybit account
3. **Check the runtime logs** for specific error messages

### "No trades happening":
1. **Check account balance** (need funds to trade)
2. **Verify API permissions** include trading (not just read-only)
3. **Check trading strategies** are enabled in dashboard

### "Need to restart":
1. **DigitalOcean Dashboard** → **Apps** → **Settings**
2. **Click "Force Rebuild and Deploy"**
3. **Wait for restart** (2-3 minutes)
