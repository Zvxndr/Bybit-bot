### Summary
Successfully integrated Binance and OKX as data-only exchanges to enhance market analysis capabilities while maintaining Bybit as the primary trading platform. The system now provides comprehensive cross-exchange price comparison, arbitrage detection, and unified market overview functionality.

### üöÄ Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Multi-Exchange Data Provider (`src/data/multi_exchange_provider.py`)
- **Complete async data integration** for Binance and OKX
- **Rate-limited API clients** with proper error handling
- **Standardized data structures** (MarketTicker, OrderBook, OHLCV)
- **Cross-exchange price comparison** functionality
- **Arbitrage opportunity detection** with configurable profit thresholds
- **Market overview aggregation** across all exchanges

#### 2. API Endpoints Integration (`src/main.py`)
- `/api/cross-exchange/tickers` - Real-time price comparison across exchanges
- `/api/arbitrage/opportunities` - Live arbitrage opportunity scanning
- `/api/market/overview` - Comprehensive market statistics and analysis

#### 3. Frontend Dashboard Enhancement (`frontend/comprehensive_dashboard.html`)
- **New Multi-Exchange tab** with complete UI integration

  - `MULTI_EXCHANGE_CACHE_TTL=30`
  - `ARBITRAGE_MIN_PROFIT_BPS=10`

### üîß Technical Architecture

#### Data Collection Strategy
- **Data-Only Approach**: No trading capabilities on Binance/OKX (read-only API access)
- **Primary Trading Platform**: Bybit remains the sole trading venue
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Cross-exchange data used for better market insights

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Caching**: 30-second TTL for market data to reduce API calls
- **Async Processing**: Parallel data collection from multiple exchanges
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when exchanges are unavailable

#### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class MarketTicker:
    symbol: str
    price: float
    bid: float
    ask: float
    volume_24h: float
    high_24h: float
    low_24h: float
    change_24h: float
    timestamp: datetime
    exchange: str
```

### üéØ Arbitrage Detection System

#### Key Capabilities
- **Cross-exchange price monitoring** for profitable spreads
- **Configurable profit thresholds** (minimum basis points)
- **Real-time opportunity identification** with buy/sell exchange recommendations
- **Risk-aware calculations** accounting for fees and slippage

#### Example Output
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "buy_exchange": "binance",
  "sell_exchange": "okx",
  "buy_price": 43250.50,
  "sell_price": 43280.75,
  "profit_bps": 70,
