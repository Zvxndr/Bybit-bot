## üîê **SECURITY SETTINGS**

### **Secret Key (Encryption)**
```bash
SECRET_KEY=k8m2n9p4q7r1s5t3u6v8w0x2y4z9a1b3c5d7e9f2g4h6j8
```
**What this does**:

- Must be 32+ characters long
- Must be unique for your deployment

**Generate at**: https://www.random.org/strings/ (32 chars, alphanumeric)

### **Dashboard Login**
```bash
DASHBOARD_USERNAME=admin                    # Your username for web login
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=MySecurePassword123!     # Your password for web login
```
**What this does**:
- When you visit your bot's URL, you'll see a login prompt
- Browser will ask for username/password
- **IMPORTANT**: Change from defaults for security!

**Security Tips**:
- Use a strong password (12+ characters)
- Mix letters, numbers, symbols
- Don't use same password as other accounts
