I'll help you develop a comprehensive plan for your personal wealth management system with clear expansion milestones and Australian regulatory considerations. Let me break this down into expertise areas, balance points for advisor engagement, and legal frameworks.

## Current System Assessment & Immediate Improvements

Based on your Bybit-bot repository analysis, I notice the main.py appears to be more of a deployment framework than actual trading logic. Let me examine the real trading components and create a development plan.Perfect! Now I can see the actual ML implementation. Your system is much more sophisticated than the main.py suggested. Let me provide a comprehensive analysis:

## **Australian Context Development Plan & Legal Framework**

Based on your location and expansion plans, here's the Australian-specific roadmap:

### **Australian Regulatory Landscape**

**Current Personal Trading (Up to $100K AUD):**
- ✅ **No specific licensing required** for personal algorithmic trading
- ✅ **CGT implications** - 50% discount if held >12 months
- ✅ **ATO crypto guidance** applies to all trading profits

**Friends & Family Investment Threshold:**
- 🚨 **$2M AUM or 20 retail clients** = AFSL (Australian Financial Services License) required
- 🚨 **Sophisticated investor exemptions** available under Corporations Act
- 🚨 **Managed Investment Scheme** rules apply with multiple investors

### **Key Australian Balance Thresholds:**

```
Personal Wealth Milestones (AUD):
├── $25K: Basic tax optimization consultation
├── $50K: Engage Australian crypto tax specialist  
├── $100K: Securities law consultation (Barry Nilsson, King & Wood Mallesons)
├── $250K: AFSL preparation consultation
├── $500K: Begin wholesale investor solicitation
├── $1M: AFSL application (if taking retail money)
└── $2M+: Full MIS compliance program
```

title: 'Australian Regulatory Planning: Friends & Family Investments Only'
description: |-
    ## Context
    This project is a personal wealth management system with plans to expand to accept investments from friends and family. No retail investments are planned. The system will be upgraded for multi-asset trading and Australian compliance, but will NOT be marketed to the public.

    ## Action Items
    - Research Australian regulations for accepting friends & family investments
    - Document requirements for staying exempt from AFSL (Australian Financial Services Licence) and Managed Investment Scheme (MIS) regulations
    - Identify the 'wholesale investor' and 'sophisticated investor' thresholds in Australia for future scaling
    - List compliance steps for onboarding friends and family (e.g., written agreements, record-keeping)
    - Create milestones for when to engage professional legal and compliance advisors based on AUM and investor count

    ## Milestones
    - <$100K AUD: Self-managed, tax optimization only
    - $100K AUD: Legal consult on AFSL/MIS exemptions
    - $250K AUD: Compliance consult for sophisticated/wholesale investor onboarding
    - $500K AUD: Formal onboarding procedures for friends/family, begin advisor engagement
    - $2M AUD: Consider AFSL application, full compliance program

    ## Notes
    - Do NOT accept retail/public investments
    - Track all friends and family investments and ensure documentation for each
    - Ensure system is ready to scale to multi-asset trading under Australian law

    ---
    This issue will help ensure legal and regulatory compliance as the project grows, and define clear balance points for advisor engagement.
