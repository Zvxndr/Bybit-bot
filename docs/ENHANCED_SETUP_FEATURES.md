- ⚠️ **Single Exchange**: Only Bybit data

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Environment Variables Created:
```bash
# Enhanced Data Sources

ENABLE_MULTI_EXCHANGE=true
```

### Configuration Impact:

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security:
- API keys are stored securely in `.env` file
- Never commit API keys to git
- Use testnet first to validate setup

### Cost Consideration:

- Multi-Exchange: **Free**
- CryptoPanic: **$19+/month** (optional)

### Performance:
- Minimal impact on system resources
- APIs are called at appropriate intervals
- Automatic fallback if APIs are down

## 🔄 Adding Sources Later

You can always add enhanced data sources later:

1. **Edit `.env` file**: Add missing API keys
2. **Update config**: Set enable flags to `true`
3. **Restart bot**: Changes take effect on restart

## 📞 Support

If you have issues with enhanced data sources:
1. Check API keys are correct
2. Verify internet connectivity
3. Test APIs manually with provided URLs
4. Check logs for detailed error messages

The bot will work fine even if enhanced sources fail - they're designed as optional enhancements, not requirements.
