# AI Trading Bot Architecture & Goals

## üéØ Core Mission
**Transform a small balance into $100K through AI-driven automated trading with dynamic risk management.**

## üöÄ Three-Phase Automated Pipeline System

### Phase 1: ML Strategy Discovery & Historical Backtesting
- **ML Engine**: `MLStrategyDiscoveryEngine` generates new strategies (3/hour configurable)
- **Historical Data**: Downloads up to 10 years of OHLCV data with sanitization
- **Backtest Engine**: `BybitEnhancedBacktestEngine` validates strategy performance
- **Graduation Criteria**: 
  - Minimum Sharpe ratio (configurable)
  - Maximum drawdown thresholds
  - Minimum return percentage
  - Trade count validation
- **Database Tracking**: `StrategyPipeline` model tracks all metrics and progression

### Phase 2: Paper Trading Validation (Bybit Testnet)
- **Real-time Testing**: Live market simulation without capital risk
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks paper P&L, trade count, success rates
- **Duration Requirements**: Minimum validation period before live consideration
- **Graduation Criteria**:
  - Minimum paper trading return (2%+)
  - Minimum validation period (14+ days)
  - Strategy stability metrics (0.8+ consistency)
  - Maximum paper drawdown limits (-5%)

### Phase 3: Live Trading Deployment (Bybit Live API)
- **Automated Promotion**: Strategies auto-graduate based on paper performance
- **Live Capital Allocation**: Dynamic allocation based on strategy confidence
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with auto-retirement
- **Risk Integration**: ML Risk Manager controls position sizing and stops

## üß† ML-First Dynamic Risk System

### Core Dynamic Risk Algorithm
```python
# Small accounts: 2% risk (aggressive growth)
# Large accounts: 0.5% risk (wealth preservation)  
# Exponential decay between $10K-$100K transition
```
