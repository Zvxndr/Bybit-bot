# 🎯 BYBIT TESTNET FUNDING GUIDE

## 📋 **IMPORTANT: Manual Funding Required**

Bybit testnet accounts start with **ZERO balance** and require manual funding. There is no API automation for this process.

## 🚀 **How to Add Test Funds**

### Step 1: Access Bybit Testnet
- Go to: **https://testnet.bybit.com/**
- Login with your testnet account credentials

### Step 2: Navigate to Wallet
- Click on **"Assets"** or **"Wallet"** in the main menu
- Look for your account balance section

### Step 3: Add Test Funds
- Find the **"Add Test Funds"** or **"Paper Trading"** button
- Click to request test funds
- Typical amounts available: **100,000 - 1,000,000 USDT**

### Step 4: Verify Funding
- Check that your balance shows the test funds
- Usually takes 1-2 minutes to appear

## 🤖 **Bot Integration Status**

Your bot is ready to detect and display real balance once funds are added:

- ✅ **API Integration**: Complete Bybit testnet connection
- ✅ **Real-time Balance**: Will show actual account balance
- ✅ **Zero Balance Detection**: Bot will display 0.00 USDT until funded
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear messages if API connection fails

## 🔍 **Expected Bot Behavior**

**Before Funding:**
```
Balance: 0.00 USDT
Daily P&L: 0.00 USDT  
Positions: 0
Status: No funds available
```

**After Funding:**
```
Balance: 100,000.00 USDT (or your requested amount)
Daily P&L: 0.00 USDT
Positions: 0
Status: Ready for trading
```

## ⚠️ **Why No API Automation?**

Bybit intentionally requires manual testnet funding to:
- Prevent API abuse and spam
- Ensure users understand testnet vs mainnet differences
- Maintain system stability
- Comply with regulatory requirements

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Add testnet funds manually** (required step)
2. **Deploy bot to DigitalOcean** with API credentials
3. **Bot will automatically fetch real balance** from API
4. **Begin testing with actual testnet funds**

Your bot is production-ready and will work perfectly once testnet funds are manually added! 🚀
