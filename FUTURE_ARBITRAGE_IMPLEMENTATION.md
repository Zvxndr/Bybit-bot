**Note**: This arbitrage implementation represents a significant expansion beyond the current data-only multi-exchange integration. It requires proper regulatory compliance, substantial capital, and institutional-grade infrastructure. The current version provides the foundational data collection and analysis capabilities that will support future arbitrage operations.

**Current Focus**: Multi-exchange price comparison and market analysis  
**Future Focus**: Full arbitrage detection, execution, and institutional fund management
